#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January
SELECT Product, sum(quantity)price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE FebSales.location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers 
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. Display the order dates that were placed between February 13 to February 18, 2019.
SELECT orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00'
ORDER BY orderdate;

#9. What is the total quantity of products ordered on February 18, 2019?
SELECT sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%';

#10. Show the employee IDs that begin with "14", followed by an unknown character after "14", and end with "9".
SELECT employee_ID
FROM employees
WHERE employee_ID LIKE '14_9';

#11. Display all order IDs in the MarSales table, where the order ID begins with "16", followed by one unknown character, then a "0", and any number of characters afterwards.
SELECT orderID
FROM BIT_DB.MarSales
WHERE orderID LIKE '16_0%';
